# Binary_Classification_ANN
## Description
A Artificial Neural Network (ANN) project written in Python
### Library used:
- Numpu (randomisation, aggregation)
- pandas (dataframe)
- matplotlib (plot of cost function descends
### Techniques used:
- unibatch
- Sigmoid function (activation function)
- Linear regression form (Y = WX +b)
- hyperparameter tuning (mainly learning rate & number of neurons)
## Source of datasets:
wine quality dataset from kaggle

## Results
